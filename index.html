        From 1963 to 1977, that is, from the release of the Beatles' first album to the outbreak of punk symbolized by the Sex Pistols. This period can be regarded as the golden age of modern rock music, and it is the period most familiar to most people.

During this period, there was no significant ideological confrontation between the so-called underground, independent and mainstream, major labels.
